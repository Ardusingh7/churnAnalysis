# Customer Churn Analysis

A machine learning project that leverages customer data to predict churn probability and reveal key factors influencing customer retention. This project is designed to help businesses identify at-risk customers and take proactive steps to improve retention using data-driven insights.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ardusingh7/churnAnalysis.git
   cd churnAnalysis
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended)

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > If `requirements.txt` is missing, ensure you install:
   > `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `jupyter`

4. **Run the notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook churnAnalysis.ipynb
   ```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Add advanced models: Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks
* Apply techniques to handle class imbalance (e.g., SMOTE)
* Build a dashboard (Streamlit/Dash/Flask) for interactive churn prediction
* Automate retraining workflows with CI/CD integration
* Connect to real-time data streams for live churn monitoring
