## 🚀 Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – uncover trends and patterns in customer behavior  
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** – clean and transform data for optimal model performance  
- **Churn Prediction Models** – train and compare machine learning models  
- **Model Evaluation** – assess results with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC  
- **Visualizations** – generate confusion matrices and ROC-AUC curves  
- **Predictive Tool** – estimate churn risk for new customers

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ardusingh7/churnAnalysis.git
   cd churnAnalysis
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
Install dependencies

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If requirements.txt is missing, ensure you install:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, jupyter

Run the notebook

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook churnAnalysis.ipynb
🔮 Future Enhancements
Add advanced models: Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks

Apply techniques to handle class imbalance (e.g., SMOTE)

Build a dashboard (Streamlit/Dash/Flask) for interactive churn prediction

Automate retraining workflows with CI/CD integration

Connect to real-time data streams for live churn monitoring
